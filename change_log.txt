0.1.3
  This version is working in a limited way:
  - the README still needs editing
  - the output give the needed information in a bad way
  - there are no command to do copy to e from the S3 archive
  - the tests comparing folder does not work yet

0.1.2d
  Now ds3diff starts doing a right comparation of a tree of files / folders.
  The output is stil very bad.

0.1.2c
  Starting putting things together but I'm not there yet
  I need to compare directory or tree, not single files.
  
0.1.2
  NOW ALL TEST PASS (also test_compare that did not pass in previous versions)
  FOUND AN IMPERFERCT SOLUTION TO THE CONCEPTUAL PROBLEM OF VERSION 1.1.1b AND 
  FOOLOWING:
  . There is no way to chec last-modified-date between local file and S3 object.
    For sure S3 last-modified-date must be greater of local file date, othervise 
    S3 object is obsolite.
  . For all files where S3.last_modified_date >= local_file.last_modified_date:
    I have to compare S3 Object eTag whith the one calculated on the local file.

0.1.1c
    NOT ALL TESTS PASS
    - Still working on experiments to find a right way to compare file on local
      disks with files on S3 (cannot compare LastModified date
    - arguments_loader.py a mudule I want to use in all module and experiments
      to load argument from env or asking them on console.
      Environment variable are safe (I am sure not to save server credentina in
      the GIT Repository). However, they are annoying to use if the argoments
      often change in different modules. Better to ask then on the console.
      TODO: better to add a validation procedure to "argumets_loader"
    - experiment files now use rich library to show more readable output

0.1.1b 
    NOT ALL TESTS PASSED
    - Renamed the samples files in experiments to avoid
    confusion between test, experiment end future
    product modules
    - test_compare.py does not pass.

    CONCEPTUAL PROBLEM - I tied to compare File System
    file with S3 objects looking for size and last-modified
    date, but S3 does not preserve the original date
    TODO - I must calculate eTag for files in file-Sysstem
    to make the process compatible with AWS S3 SYNC
    way of working, or find some other workaround that
    does not require compare last-modified date
